# Friends
A program that uses graphs, breadth-first traversal, and depth-first traversals to connect people together in friend groups and are connected by mutual friends. Each person each person may or may not also be a student, and what school if that person is a student. It can find cliques based on connected friends within the same school, find the shortest path between 2 people connected through mutual friends, and find people who are “connector,” people that are necessary for 2 people in the graph to be connected.
The part that I programmed were the bodies of the shortestChain, cliques, searchThrough, connectors, and connecting methods.
